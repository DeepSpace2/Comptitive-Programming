## Description

The number `S` is called the mean of two numbers `R`<sub>`1`</sub> and `R`<sub>`2`</sub> if `S` is equal to `(R`<sub>`1`</sub> `+` `R`<sub>`2`</sub>`) / 2`. Mirko’s birthday present for Slavko was two integers `R`<sub>`1`</sub> and `R`<sub>`2`</sub>. Slavko promptly calculated their mean which also happened to be an integer but then lost `R`<sub>`1`</sub>! Help Slavko restore `R`<sub>`1`</sub>.

## Input

The first and only line of input contains two integers `R`<sub>`1`</sub> and `S`, both between `−1000` and `1000`.

## Output

Output `R`<sub>`2`</sub> on a single line.
