## Description

The number `S` is called the mean of two numbers `R`<sub>`1`</sub> and `R`<sub>`2`</sub> if `S` is equal to `(R`<sub>`1`</sub> `+` `R`<sub>`2`</sub>`) / 2`. Mirko’s birthday present for Slavko was two integers `R`<sub>`1`</sub> and `R`<sub>`2`</sub>. Slavko promptly calculated their mean which also happened to be an integer but then lost `R`<sub>`1`</sub>! Help Slavko restore `R`<sub>`1`</sub>.

## Input
